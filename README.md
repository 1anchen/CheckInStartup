## Airport Check-In

We need to build a new airport desk check-in application.
The users are the airline staff who have to check in customers and ensure
they and their bags are fully accounted for in preparation for them boarding the
aeroplane.

### Steps
* Design class hierarchy from User Stories
* Create other tasks from user stories (breakdown) and add to backlog.
* Complete one or two tasks or User Stories per sprint.

### User Stories
We need the following User Stories completed to start with.

#### The one where you check a passenger in

* *As a* member of check in staff
*  *I want* to be able to check in guests
* *So that* the airline and operators know if all or
 some of the guests are accounted for


 #### The one where you check their bag in

 #### The one where they have normal size bags

 #### The one where they have outsize bag

 ### Further work:

#### The one where passengers board the Aeroplane
#### The one where passengers declare a list of customs items when checking in.
